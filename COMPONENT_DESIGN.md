# Web Component Design Best Practices

Best practices for developing presentational web components that have a nice API and are easy to work with.

The general principle at work in this document is that our presentational components should have APIs that are
consistent with native browser elements. They should feel familiar to users who are comfortable working with
native input elements and controls.

- [Prefer structured markup](#prefer-structured-markup-over-complex-attributes-or-js-interfaces)
- [Use a consistent input API](#use-a-consistent-api-for-components-that-accept-input)
- [Don't use reflect](#dont-use-reflect)

## Prefer structured markup over complex attributes or js interfaces

Imagine we're going to create a component for representing menus. Menu data might look like this:

```javascript
{
  appetizers: [
    { name: 'fried pickles', price: 400 },
    { name: 'bruschetta', price: 500 }
  ],
  entrees: [
    { name: 'tacos', price: 600 },
    { name: 'hamburger', price: 700 }
  ]
}
```

### Structured Markup (good)

This is a nice design. It lets the structure of the document match the structure of the data. If the API
need to be changed or split in the future, small pieces can be changed (like just updating `gux-menu-item`) while
the rest of the API remains stable. It's fairly easy to read and find problems in the input.

```html
<gux-menu>
  <gux-menu-section slot="appetizers">
    <gux-menu-item price="400">fried pickles</gux-menu-item>
    <gux-menu-item price="500">bruschetta</gux-menu-item>
  </gux-menu-section>
  <gux-menu-section slot="entrees">
    <gux-menu-item price="600">tacos</gux-menu-item>
    <gux-menu-item price="700">hamburger</gux-menu-item>
  </gux-menu-section>
</gux-menu>
```

### Complex Attributes (bad)

This design is less useful. Putting the entire API into a single string makes the interface fragile (a stray typo
will break input parsing). Contract violations are also harder to detect, as there's one big contract for a single
element instead of multiple small contracts for small elements.

```html
<gux-menu menu-data="{ appetizers: [ ... ], entrees: [ ... ]}"></gux-menu>
```

### JS API (bad)

This approach is even less useful than an attribute, since it shares most of the same disadvantages and
attributes can be accessed both via markup and a JavaScript API.

```html
<gux-menu id="theMenu"></gux-menu>
<script>
  document.getElmentById('theMenu').setData(menuData);
</script>
```

## Use a consistent API for components that accept input

For components that accept user input somehow, there should be consistent APIs for setting the value of
those components and for events emitted by the components. In particular components that accept input:

- Should have a `value` attribute and property, like the various native input-related elements
  - An additional boolean attribute similar to `checked` may be appropriate for elements with boolean state.
- Should emit the `input` event (at a minimum) with the `detail` property on the event set to the data the
  component is intended to get from the user.

## Don't use reflect

Stencil properties can be set with the option `reflect`. When set, a change in an elements property will
also change the value of the attribute in the DOM. For example, when dealing with this input element:

```html
<my-custom-input id="myInput" value="default"></my-custom-input>
```

If `reflect` was set on `value`, then calling `document.getElementById("myInput").value = "new value"` would
mean that `document.getElementById("myInput").getAttr("value")` would now return "new value". This is _not_ how
native browser elements behave. It also puts the internal implementation of the component in conflict with the surrounding
framework used to render it about what the attribute's value should be, since it is being set twice, potentially leading
to bugs.
